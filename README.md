<a href="https://www.theforage.com/simulations/pwc-ch/power-bi-cqxg" target="_blank"><img src="assets/banner.png"/><a/>

This repository contains a series of Power BI projects based on a job simulation provided by [**PwC Switzerland** through **Forage**](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/pwc-ch/power-bi-cqxg). The aim is to gain hands-on experience with data analysis and visualization tools like Power BI, focusing on real-world business challenges such as customer retention, call center performance, and diversity & inclusion initiatives.

By completing these tasks, participants develop skills in:

- Data visualization
- Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Data-driven decision making
- Power BI dashboard creation
- Analytical thinking

The simulation is divided into three different very insightful projects:
1. **Call Center Trends Analysis**: Visualizing customer satisfaction and agent performance.
2. **Customer Retention Analysis**: Identifying key metrics to predict customer churn and improve loyalty.
3. **Diversity & Inclusion Analysis**: Tracking and improving gender balance at the executive level.
